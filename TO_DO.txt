# To do file:
# -- switch script from running on a single trajectory, using a bash script to iterate over many trajectories; implement the same structure I use in RMSD analysis scripts to loop over many trajectories in one script;

# I've noticed that this script runs slowly when I have numerous instances of it running on my desktop; I think this is because there is so much creating/writing to file and switching btw python and bash scripts;
