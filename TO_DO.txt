# To do file:
# DONE -- switch script from running on a single trajectory, using a bash script to iterate over many trajectories; implement the same structure I use in RMSD analysis scripts to loop over many trajectories in one script;
# -- add timing functionality to measure how long is spent on the calculation; print these results to the output file...


# I've noticed that this script runs slowly when I have numerous instances of it running on my desktop; I think this is because there is so much creating/writing to file and switching btw python and bash scripts;
